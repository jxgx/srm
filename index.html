  <p>Created in 2024, Soft Relax Media works primarily with lo-fi ASMR and psychophysical digital aesthetics. Soft Relax Media shoots original gonzo explorations with efficiency and grew 18,000 organic subscribers on YouTube in only 8 months. We averaged 1.4 million video views per month across channel content before being removed from the platform due to the graphic themes of our content. We have no regrets. Our work has been called "extremely fascinating," "erotic and uncomfortable," and "a totally new experience."</p>
  <p>We embrace the moment of confrontation between the landscape of the body and the pure gaze. Our works are inspired by timeless artists such as Roger Watkins, Hisayasu Sato, Vincent Gallo, Gregory Dark, Philippe Garrel, Yasujiro Ozu, James Benning, Nicolas Winding Refn, Dale Berry, David Lynch, Russ Meyer, Michael Ninn, David Cronenberg, George Kuchar, and Carl Dreyer among others. Contact us for collaborative possibilities and contracted video work.</p>
