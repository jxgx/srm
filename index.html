  <p>Created in 2024, Soft Relax Media works primarily with lo-fi ASMR and psychophysical dreamcore gonzo (POV) explorations for visual mediums. We shoot quick and with efficiency. Soft Relax Media grew 18,000 organic subscribers on YouTube (mainly US and Brazilian traffic w/ organic engagement). We averaged 1.4 million video views per month across channel content before being suddenly (and irrevocably) removed from the platform due to the graphic nature of our content, which, has been called "extremely fascinating," "erotic and uncomfortable," and "icky." We embrace the moment of confrontation between the flesh and the liminal gaze. Our works are inspired by timeless artists such as Roger Watkins, Hisayasu Sato, Vincent Gallo, Gregory Dark, Philippe Garrel, Ozu, James Benning, NWR, Dale Berry, and Carl Dreyer among others. Contact us for collaborative possibilities and contracted video work.</p>
