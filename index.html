  <p>Created in 2024 in Los Angeles, Soft Relax Media works primarily with lo-fi psychophysical digital aesthetics and shoots these gonzo rituals with efficiency and viral consideration. We grew 18,000 organic subscribers on YouTube in only 8 months and averaged 1.4 million video views per month across channel content with no financial backing. And no regrets. In August 2024, we were banned from YouTube due to the graphic psychophysical nature of our content. Our work has been called "extremely fascinating," "erotic and uncomfortable," and "a totally new experience."</p>
  <p>We embrace the moment of confrontation between the mysterious landscape of the body and the gaze itself. Our works are inspired by timeless artists such as Roger Watkins, Hisayasu Sato, Vincent Gallo, Gregory Dark, Philippe Garrel, Yasujiro Ozu, James Benning, Nicolas Winding Refn, Dale Berry, David Lynch, Russ Meyer, Michael Ninn, David Cronenberg, George Kuchar, and Carl Dreyer among others.</p>
  <p>Contact us to collaborate. We are open to digital cinema, unorthodox clip work, and psychological operations of various kinds.</p>
