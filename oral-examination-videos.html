  <p>Oral Examination videos feature a human subject who opens their mouth for the camera. In its most pure form, the oral examination video presents the human mouth to the camera without judgement or narrative framing. The only framing that exists arises through the title of "Oral Examination" or "Oral Exam" video. Frequently, these videos were popularized on YouTube by such channels as Soft Relax Media among others. These videos are stark, simple, effective, and confrontational. The purpose of the video depends upon the channel and/or the director. In the case of Soft Relax Media, Oral Examination videos were produced to create a kind of psychophysical ASMR reaction in the viewer. There is a great challenge in gazing at certain parts of the body. There is an aversion to such confrontation. Many viewers would prefer not to look into the body. Or, when presented without context, the body can take on an almost inhuman form. There is an alien presence that arises when gazing on a certain part of the body without context, without narration. These oral examination explorations become art when framed in this way, especially when the director chooses the subject as opposed to documenting any random patient for purely medical reaons. These videos exist for artistic and entertainment purposes</p>

<h2>Oral Examination Videos for ASMR Purposes</h2>
  <br>
  <p>The Oral Exam video arose through the proliferation of ASMR content. ASMR stands for "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response." ASMR videos excite a sensation in the body. They are meant to be experienced as sensory explorations. The videos often produce "tingles" in the throat, the back of the neck, the stomach, or elsewhere. These videos tend to relax the viewer with a kind of inner and outer softness. Soft Relax Media, on the other hand, decided to produce ASMR videos that would confront the viewer with a quiet landscape of the human body. In doing so, Soft Relax Media created a new of kind of ASMR experience, a merging of focused attention, direct confrontation, radical honesty, and fantasy elements. Thus, in the 2024 feature film "Sorority Girl Massacre: Black Static at the Moment of Death," the Oral Examination trope is used to great effect as the slasher uses this technique to bear witness to a potential victim. Seen in this way, the Oral Examination becomes a kind of Cronenbergian body horror trope. Elevated from its medical origins, the Oral Exam becomes "shot through" with a dark significance. The human body, thus, becomes more mysterious and more alien than we ever could have imagined.</p>

  <h3><p>Oral Exam Video Example: Jade</p></h3>

  <br>
  <p>The above video documents an example of an oral examination as conducted by Soft Relax Media. This video shows a model (Jade) who opens her mouth for the camera. The camera becomes a detached observer, yet also exists as a sudden force that pushes in toward the mouth. The camera lingers. The camera hovers. The camera simply observes nothing more than a female human mouth. The camera itself has no intentionality. THe experience is viewed through the interpretation of the viewer. In this case, the oral examination presents a body. The experience of being presented with a body allows us to become ethically responsible for our own actions and interpretations of the art. Some may view the body as a site of repulsion while others may view the body as a site of sexual excitation. Others might view the body from the perspective of an oral hygienist or a medical student. The range of emotions and/or reactions to such a view can be hard to comprehend or predict. As exampled above, a simple video like this becomes horror when filtered through the narrative of a modern slasher movie.</p>

  <h3><p>Oral Exam Video Example: Laura</p></h3>
  <br>
  <p><iframe class="rumble" width="640" height="360" src="https://rumble.com/embed/v59o4be/?pub=3an0fk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <br>
  <p>Laura lies on her back. Her gaze is fixed on the ceiling. She is instructed to open her mouth and to leave her mouth open. No further instructions are given. Laura is a professional model in the Los Angeles area. She opens her mouth and looks up at the ceiling as the camera pushes inward toward the mouth. Throughout this examination, the director may or may not gesture (non-verbally) to encourage Laura to adjust her tongue or to open her mouth in a slightly different way. The experience becomes timeless. While the mouth is held open, time does not exist. Laura feels the pull of her muscles. The room is silent. A shot that only lasts less than three mintues feels like an eternity. This kind of ontological ASMR experience is a phenomenological fact. Oral Examination videos can expand or shrink time. For some viewers, time becomes a blankness, a kind of place-of-forgetting. This elevates the Oral Exam ASMR video experience to the aesthetic realm.</p>

  <h3><p>Oral Exam Video Example: Donna</p></h3>
  <br>
  <p><iframe class="rumble" width="640" height="360" src="https://rumble.com/embed/v59mt1x/?pub=3an0fk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
  <br>
  <p>Donna is a model and musician in the Los Angeles area. Her Oral Examination was conducted several nights before she would have her wisdom teeth extracted. Shortly after this video, she rubbed oral numbing gel on her gums to ease the suffering she was undergoing. The director opted to end the shoot early, but Donna insisted on shooting. Donna presented her mouth without context and opened it to confront the silence of the night. This opening was a poetic gesture and a gesture of beauty. In certain artistic periods, the nude body was painted. Sculptors made realistic replicas of the human form. However, the oral examination as an artistc action was not documented in this way. The act of viewing an Oral Examination presents a kind of anti-ASMR experience of confrontation in certain viewers, while others feel an overwhelming sense of calm. The mouth is a site of beauty and of horror. Perhaps, beauty and horror exist side-by-side. Perhaps, we have not yet tapped into the rich psychophysical mysteries that the human body possesses and opens for us in your imagination. May we ever wonder and continue to experience the beauty of this life. The Oral Examination video series can help expand and enrich that beauty.</p>
